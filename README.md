# ERS-Implementation

This project demonstrates the Expanding Ring Search (ERS) technique, a controlled flooding method often used in reactive routing protocols. The implementation uses ICMP messages to trace routers along a network path, mimicking functionality similar to traceroute. 

```./prog <hop-distance> <destination>``` to execute ERS
